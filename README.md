# The Direct Ethics and Reporting Policy

The Direct strives for objective and accurate news coverage. When we do report on sensitive topics, we aim to cover it as objectively as possible.

The Direct aims for quick, accurate and complete reporting at all times. If we ever need to make a correction to our work, we will do so as swiftly as we are made aware of the error. The Direct's goal is to get accurate information to our readers as fast as possible, so any breaking news stories will be expanded on after publication of the original article if necessary.

When our journalism is factually correct but the language we used to explain those facts is not as clear or detailed as it should be, the language should be rewritten and a clarification added to the story. A clarification can also be used to note that we initially failed to seek a comment or response that has since been added to the story or that new reporting has shifted our account of an event.

Depending on the extent to which information is reported incorrectly, we may publish a correction on social media. Our corrections might include a comment under the original post, or a deletion of the originl post and a repost with the corrected information.
